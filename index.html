                    <div class="text">Hi!
                        I am an 18 year old art enthusiast, studying graphic design at Symbiosis
                        Institute of Design, who loves to indulge and express my creativity and
                        opinions through art and music.
                        I would describe myself as a curious and friendly person with a positive
                        outlook towards life. My strengths lie in working hard and diligently while
                        maintaining my calm under pressure. I mostly enjoy sketching portraits
                        and observing things in a unique way and love to challenge myself with
                        creative ideas and sharing them online.
                        I foresee myself becoming a designer one day.

                    <h3>Art</h3>
                    <p>Art has been my passion since childhood, and as a self-taught artist, I’ve continually refined my
                        skills, focusing on portraiture for the past four years. In 2021, I began offering commissioned
                        artwork, combining my love for visual storytelling with a commitment to meeting clients'
                        personal needs. Each commission is crafted with attention to detail and emotional depth,
                        ensuring that every piece reflects the essence of the subject. My goal is to create meaningful,
                        high-quality art while fostering lasting relationships with my clients. Through my work, I aim
                        to provide a personalized and memorable experience for every project.

                    <h3>Graphic Designing</h3>
                    <p>With a natural inclination towards design, I’ve always been drawn to graphic elements like
                        packages, posters, and magazines. Although I excelled in Fine Arts, my passion for visual
                        communication led me to pursue a career in Graphic Design. Currently studying at Symbiosis
                        Institute of Design, I am deeply engaged in the world of design and creativity. Throughout my
                        first year, I have completed multiple internships & Freelance Works, gaining hands-on experience
                        in diverse design projects. I continue to seek more opportunities to expand my skills and grow
                        as a designer, striving to bring creativity and innovation to every project.

                    <h3>Video Editing</h3>
                    <p>My journey with video editing began in 2019 when I started my YouTube channel to showcase my art
                        process. While shooting and editing my videos, I developed a deep interest in filmmaking and
                        cinematography. This passion led me to explore the creation of engaging reels and YouTube
                        videos, blending creativity with technical skills. With a natural inclination towards video
                        editing, I’ve honed my abilities through both personal projects and professional freelance work.
                        I strive to craft visually compelling and impactful videos, focusing on storytelling, rhythm,
                        and engagement to captivate audiences.
